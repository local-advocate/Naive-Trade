Will explain in detail later.

Problems:
    - Lower yields than total profit.
    - Sometimes selling lower than the bought price because of the high frequency.
    - Profits super low, need to increase 
    - If the price does not go above the opening price, it would never make any trades
    - Or once a downward trend starts, we cannot take advantage of any peaks and valleys afterwards
    - if the slope of decrease not too much ---- hold

Solutions:
    - Wait more? (sells if after 5 data points price is less)
    - Price is less than peak (max) && higher than buyPrice
    - More variance with small consistent trends
    - Last problem soln: remove the && higher than buyPrice???
