# Description

Trying to come up with trading algorithms. These are beginner approaches to understand the issues of algorithmic trading and to understand more advanced algorithms better.

## Files & Folders

1. Experiment  
   1. simpleAlgo.py&emsp;&emsp;:&emsp;Buy on upwards trend and sell on a downwards trend.  
   2. yFinance.py&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:&emsp;*simpleAlgo.py* combined with real world data using the *yfinance* library.
   3. average.py&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;:&emsp;Takes average of every running data point. Buys when below average, sells when above it.
   4. discAverage.py&emsp;&ensp;:&emsp;Same idea as *average.py* but with a much accurate average (only the last few points matter).
   5. README.md&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;:&emsp;Explanation of the algorithms and problems with them.
   6. images&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;:&emsp;Folder consisting images regarding the algorithm results.

## How to Run
