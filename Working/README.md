## Algorithms
1. Moving Average (*movingAverage.py*)
   
   * Measures the moving average of a given stock with a given period and an interval.
   The algorithm buys the share if it is above the average and sells if it is below the running average.  
   
   Usage:
   ```
   python movingAverage.py
   ```
   
   Output:

   Problems:
   * We miss out selling before downard trends and buying at the beginning of upward trends.
   Thus, we end up incurring great losses.
   * We need a way to follow the trends.
   
2. BOLL Bands Visualization (*bollBands.py*)
   
   * Displays upper and lower BOLL bands alongwith the average and the shaded area in between.  
   
   Usage:
   ```
   python bollBands.py
   ```
   
   Output:

3. Follow Trends (*followTrend.py*)
   
   * Follows the moving average of a given stock with a given period and an interval.
   The algorithm buys the share if the average trend is increasing and sells if the average is decreasing.  
   * We sell immediately if the average decreases (and the selling price is higher than the buying price)
   because for the average to decrease rapidly the price must have changed drastically.
   * We cannot sell if the price is lower than the buying price because it leads to the same issues as before
   i.e. we end up selling at immensely low prices.
   * However, the result of this algorithm is a significant improvement because we take advantage out of big trends.
   
   Usage:
   ```
   python followTrend.py
   ```
   
   Output:

   Problems:
   * The main problem is that we might miss out on some trends because we cannot sell at a lower price than the
   buying price.
   * For example, at the end of the above graph, we miss out on the last drastic price increase.
   * One possible solution is to implement partial buying (separate buy prices to follow multiple trends).
