## Algorithms
1. Moving Average (*movingAverage.py*)
   
   * Measures the moving average of a given stock with a given period and an interval.
   The algorithm buys the share if it is above the average and sells if it is below the running average.  
   
   Usage:
   ```
   python movingAverage.py
   ```
   
   Output:

   Problems:
   * We miss out selling before downard trends and buying at the beginning of upward trends.
   Thus, we end up incurring great losses.
   * We need a way to follow the trends.
   
2. BOLL Bands Visualization (*bollBands.py*)
   
   * Displays upper and lower BOLL bands alongwith the average and the shaded area in between.  
   
   Usage:
   ```
   python bollBands.py
   ```
   
   Output:
